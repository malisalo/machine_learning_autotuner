<p>Maize research is widely conducted throughout the world because of its popularity as a model agricultural crop. In recent years, an essential tool in maize research has been machine learning models, as it provides useful insight in the analysis of complex datasets and predictive outcomes to improve crop yield. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of these models, hyperparameter tuning is an important step in the machine learning process. This process involves adjusting model training parameters to achieve optimal performance and accuracy. However, identifying the best machine learning model and tuning its parameters can be a challenging and time-consuming process. To address this problem, we developed a web application that integrates multiple machine learning methods and automates hyperparameter tuning, simplifying the process of training classification models. This project focuses on developing a user-friendly application where users can test different machine learning algorithms and automate hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. To demonstrate the impact of hyperparameter tuning, multiple machine learning models were trained using a dataset that was collected from various maize inbreds under different environmental stressors. Our results show that experimenting with various machine learning models and tuning the modelâ€™s parameters can improve model performance. This project provides an accessible tool for researchers, helping them efficiently find the best model for classification problems.</p>
